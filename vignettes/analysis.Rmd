# Preamble

The `ProjectAsPackage` package and this vignette provide a template for generating reproducible analyses as an R package. [Its repo](https://www.github.com/waldronlab/ProjectAsPackage) is set up as a GitHub "template" allowing you to initiate a new repository with it as the starting point for a new analysis.


For interactive / manual vignette building, setting caching instead to TRUE 
can dramatically speed up the builds, by caching the results of each chunk. The caching line is not shown in output because of the option `echo=FALSE`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=FALSE)
```

# Research Question

A short sentence describing the question central to the analysis.

# Introduction

Explain the purpose of the vignette. Give a brief explanation of the questions
that will be answered and some background information. These vignettes are
written in [Rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). You can find [details
about markdown here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) and
[details about code chunks
here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_rcodechunks.html).

# Assumptions

All biological analyses have assumptions.

- Assumption 1
- Assumption 2

# Resources

## Data

Information about the data. 

Note that there are several ways to include data in your package, documented at 
http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html

**ProjectAsPackage** demonstrates two ways:
1. as a prepared R object (in this case `data.frame`) prepared and stored as `data/gardasil.rda`in the package's directory and documented in the file `R/gardasil.R`.
2. as a *.csv* file `inst/extdata/gardasil.csv`

# Analysis (divided into sections)

Example Sections

## Section 1: Load the data

You might choose to hide this code using the option `echo=FALSE` in the code chunks below.

### Option 1 - data cleaning done prior to saving an R object in package directory `data/gardasil.rda`:

```{r}
data(gardasil)
class(gardasil)
summary(gardasil)
```
The data-cleaning script used to create the `data/gardasil.rda` file is traditionally provided in the `data-raw/` Note that there is a help file for this dataset as well, serving as a codebook. This was generated by the file `R/gardasil.R` using *roxygen* markup, then using *roxygen2* to automatically create the documentation file `man/gardasil.Rd`:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?gardasil
```

### Option 2 - a function to load and clean the raw data

See the function `R/read_gardasil.R`, with automatically-generated help page `man/read_gardasil.Rd`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?read_gardasil
```

```{r}
gardasil2 <- read_gardasil()
class(gardasil2)
summary(gardasil2)
```

You may wish to provide arguments to this function, e.g.:
```{r}
summary(gardasil2$RaceSummary)
gardasil3 <- read_gardasil(other.as.NA = TRUE)
summary(gardasil3$RaceSummary)
```

# Session Information

This shows which packages and versions were used for the analysis. Note that under
RStudio "Tools - Project Options" you can select "Packrat" to create a project-specific
library to ensure other analysts will run the exact same version of all packages.
